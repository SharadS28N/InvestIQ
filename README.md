## ðŸ“– About InvestIQ

InvestIQ is on a mission to empower investors across Nepal by providing sophisticated, AI-powered tools and insights. Built specifically with the Nepali market in mind, our platform enables usersâ€”from individual retail traders to institutional investorsâ€”to make smarter, data-driven investment decisions on the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE).

## ðŸ“š Our Story

InvestIQ was founded by five friends with a simple mission: to make sophisticated investment tools accessible to every Nepali investor.

We recognized that while the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) offers tremendous opportunities, many investors lack the tools, data, and insights needed to make informed decisions. Our team of financial experts and AI specialists came together to build a platform that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with deep market knowledge.

Today, InvestIQ serves thousands of investors across Nepal, from individual retail traders to large institutional clients. We continue to innovate and improve our platform, always with our core mission in mind:  
**Invest Smarter, Grow Better.**
